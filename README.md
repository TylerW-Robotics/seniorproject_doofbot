# seniorproject_doofbot

Doofbot was a Capstone project done by Robert B and Tyler W. 
A Doofbot is a turtle bot that uses a Raspberry pi 3B+ and uses ROS kinetic as a framework. 
The goal of this project is to create an autonomous mobile robot that creates a mobile robot that uses image processing to guide the robot through a flat grid platform and use an A* search algorithm to find the shortest path to the goal, all wrapped together with ROS.
